# Olly - Local LLM Chat

Personal project to continue self-development and exploration with AI. For the project I'm building out a local AI assistant app using Ollama, SvelteKit, and Tauri. Ollama is a great open-source project for running LLMs privately on a local machine, while Tauri, similar to Electron, is a lightweight framework for building fast, cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies and Rust.

So far, have the basics of the app set up: Ollama serving the LLMs via the API, rendering markdown, added conversational and vision capabilities, implementing basic model and theme management, and even having AI determine the appropriate UI iconography based on the weather.

Areas to explore next:

- Using Tauri to access native system APIs to integrate with other desktop apps.
- Tool calling to interact with external functions and APIs, e.g., adding search.
- RAG and Conversation history
- Canvas interactions to create more multimodal experiences, like drawing to generate or edit.

Doesnâ€™t play games as well as WOPR...yet. Planning to eventually distribute it on the App Store, but for now you can check it here. Personal project to learn  more about local AI development with SvelteKit and Tauri. Using AI to its full potential...Dad joke generator.
